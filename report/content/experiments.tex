Here we look closer at the \textit{PageRank} and \todo{other} experiment, first we detail the authors work before proposing an alternative approach. Both experiments where originally ran on two graphs, \textit{twitter\_rv} \cite{twitter} and \textit{uk-2007-05} \cite{uk2007}. However exact configuration of the platforms or the specification on which either parallel or single-threaded implementations where run are unknown. 
The authors wrote their own implementation for both experiments in \textit{Rust}. Their implementation initially loaded the graphs edges in vertex order, loading all edges for one vertex before moving to the next. \textit{GraphLab} and \textit{GraphX} save on data exchange by partition the edges between workers without this requirement \cite{graphlab,graphx}. Thus a second implementation was tested for which the edges where pre ordered so cache behaviour is more favourable using Hilbert order.

\subsection{PageRank}
The pagerank algorithm iteratively updates a rank for each vertex in a directed graph. Each iteration the rank is divided between a vertex neighbours. Then the vertex rank is updated to the sum of its neighbours with a dampening factor applied. It was the originally algorithm used by Google to rank a websites significance.
