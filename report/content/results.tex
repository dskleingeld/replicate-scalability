The experiments where run on the DAS-5 cluster at Leiden University \cite{das5}. The cluster consists of 24 nodes each with dual eight core Xeon E5-2630v3 cpu's and 64 GB of memory. The nodes are connected by FDR Infiniband interconnects. Here I present the authors results and mine, as the systems and graphs used are not the same we focus on the ratios between the results. Here we present the two replicated experiments separately before drawing a general conclusion in the next section \cref{conl}.
